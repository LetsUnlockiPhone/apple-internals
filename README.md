[presented on a website](https://mroi.github.io/apple-internals). A [Nix 
flake](https://github.com/tweag/rfcs/blob/flakes/rfcs/0049-flakes.md) allows to build the 
following externally hosted tools:

[**acextract**](https://github.com/bartoszj/acextract)  
Unpacks asset catalogs to individual files.

[**snapUtil**](https://github.com/ahl/apfs)
