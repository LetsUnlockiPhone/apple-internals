Apple Internals
===============

This repository provides tools and information to help understand and analyze the internals 
of Appleâ€™s operating system platforms. Specifically, a [Nix 
flake](https://github.com/tweag/rfcs/blob/flakes/rfcs/0049-flakes.md) allows to build the 
following externally hosted tools:

[**acextract**](https://github.com/bartoszj/acextract)  
Unpacks asset catalogs to individual files.

[**snapUtil**](https://github.com/ahl/apfs)  
Manages APFS snapshots.
